        <h2 class="h2 white bold">the Developer</h2>
        <p class="p white"><br>Anssi Janttonen is a dedicated student at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Finland. 
            His journey into the world of board games 
            began approximately five years ago when his fiancée introduced him to the thriving board game community in Joensuu. 
            What started as a casual interest quickly evolved into a deep passion, leading Anssi to explore game mechanics, strategy, and design at a more intricate level.
            <br><br>
            Over the years, he has immersed himself in the hobby, analyzing various games and their mechanics while refining his own ideas. 
            His dedication and curiosity have driven him to experiment with unique gameplay concepts, culminating in the development of Momentum, 
            his first fully realized board game. Momentum represents not just a game but the fulfillment of a long-held dream—bringing his 
            creative vision to life and sharing it with others who love strategy and innovation as much as he does.<br></p>
