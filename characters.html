            <h2 class="h2 white bold">Alvis, The clockwork Strategist</h2>
            <p class="p white">Alvis is not just a fighter but a tactical genius, utilizing his mechanical nature to adapt and optimize in the heat of battle. 
            Each strike is calculated, and every movement is fueled by an endless source of energy coursing through his core. Alvis fights with purpose, blending raw power and ingenuity to overwhelm opponents.
            <br><br>
            Alvis is revered among his people as a pioneer of mechanical augmentation and engineering. His creation of the Gear system allowed the machinefolk to push their limits, 
            using specialized tools and components to gain an edge in combat. However, his analytical mind can sometimes make him seem detached, more focused on efficiency than emotional connection.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 white bold">Bao, The Swaying Tempest</h2>
            <p class="p white">“The world spins, the ground sways, and yet I stand unshaken. Care for a drink?”<br><br>
            Bao is a master of the drunken fist, an art that combines seemingly chaotic movements with flawless precision. 
                Once a renowned fighter in his homeland, Bao became disillusioned with structured martial arts tournaments and rigid discipline. 
                He abandoned the arenas for a life of wandering, searching for meaning at the bottom of every gourd of wine he could find. 
                Though perpetually tipsy, Bao has an uncanny knack for adapting to any situation, his movements unpredictable yet purposeful. 
                He has become both a legend and a mystery, with stories of his exploits growing more absurd with each retelling—much like Bao himself.
                Bao's unique style is rooted in his unpredictability. While his opponents struggle to follow his erratic movements, he dances between attacks with precision,
                 all while maintaining a carefree grin. Despite his carefree demeanor, Bao possesses deep wisdom and a sharp mind hidden beneath his drunken exterior.</p>
